The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global crisis having affected every corner of the globe and the lives of every individual. Some countries have fared better in being able to control the Covid spread and keep the Covid death rate low while others have suffered huge causalities.

Using the John Hopkins database on Covid-19 data, i would like to observe if there is any pattern of association between deaths per capita and confirmed cases per capita. For research purposes, i would only be using the data for the day of 09-24-2020.

We will be working with 4 main variables during the analysis:

1.  country: The name of each country

2.  death: Total number of deaths in each country

3.  confirmed: Total number of registered cases in each country

4.  population: Number of people with permanent residence residing in each country

There were a lot of data quality issues that had to be dealt with before analysis. In many places, the country names were spelled differently which had to be corrected. There were some organizations, unions, and organizations listed in the country column which had to be removed so that we could keep our focus on countries. The numeric columns had missing values so the rows with missing values had to be entirely removed.

df_clean <- read_csv('covid_pop_09_24_2020_clean.csv')

# We select relevant columns for analysis
df <- df_clean %>% select(country,confirmed,death,population)

```

Our original table consists of population, no of deaths and no of confirmed cases variables. For easy interpretation of population variable, we first divide the population column by 100,000. In order to get per capita values for both no of deaths and confirmed cases, we will divide both columns by the population. We wont remove any extreme values as the count doesnt look like an error.

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# For possible log transformations, we remove rows with '0' values
df <- df %>% filter(death != 0)

# Divide population by 100,000 for easier measurements and interpretation
df <- df %>% mutate(population = (population/1000000)) 

# Finding deaths per capita 
df <- df %>% mutate(deaths_per_capita = round((death / population),digits = 2))

# Finding confirmed cases per capita
df <- df  %>% mutate(cases_per_capita = round((confirmed / population),digits = 2))

df <-  df %>% select(country,death, confirmed,cases_per_capita, deaths_per_capita, population)

df_histogram <- df
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(df,3))
```

## **Summary statistics for X and Y variables**

Histograms for both 'no of Covid related deaths' and 'no of confirmed Covid cases' are right skewed (**Appendix:** **Figure 1**). The median is greater then the mean. This kind of distribution has a large number of occurrences in the lower value cells (left side) and few in the upper value cells (right side). There are some extreme values in both histograms caused by the very high number of confirmed Covid cases and deaths in United States, India, and Brazil.

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary_cases_per_capita <- df %>% summarise(
  mean     = mean(cases_per_capita),
  median   = median(cases_per_capita),
  std      = sd(cases_per_capita),
  min      = min(cases_per_capita),
  max      = max(cases_per_capita))

summary_deaths_per_capita <- df %>% summarise(
  mean     = mean(deaths_per_capita),
  median   = median(deaths_per_capita),
  std      = sd(deaths_per_capita),
  min      = min(deaths_per_capita),
  max      = max(deaths_per_capita))
 
summary_population <- df %>% summarise(
  mean     = mean(population),
  median   = median(population),
  std      = sd(population),
  min      = min(population),
  max      = max(population))

summary_stats2 <- summary_cases_per_capita %>% add_row(summary_deaths_per_capita) %>% add_row(summary_population)

row.names(summary_stats2) <- c("cases_per_capita", "deaths_per_capita", "population")


```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Preview table
kable(summary_stats2)

```

## **Investigation of the transformation of our variables**

We will be working with the following equation:

*deaths\_per\_capita = alpha + beta \* cases\_per\_capita*

It is important to think beforehand what kind of transformations are feasible or not. We would like a transformation that explains the association between the dependent and independent variable clearly and interpretations that make the most sense. Hence, we will visualize the model with different log transformations.

**Level-Level Model:** deaths\_per\_capita = alpha + beta \* cases\_per\_capita (**Figure 2**)

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot( df , aes(x = cases_per_capita, y = deaths_per_capita)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="loess")+
  labs(x = "Registered cases per capita (2019)",y = "Deaths per capita (2019)") 
```

**Level - Log Model:** deaths\_per\_capita = alpha + beta \* ln\_cases\_per\_capita (**Figure 3**)

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot( df , aes(x = cases_per_capita, y = deaths_per_capita)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="loess")+
  labs(x = "Registered cases per capita (2019), ln scale",y = "Deaths per capita (2019)")  +
  scale_x_continuous( trans = log_trans(), breaks = c(1,2,5,10,20,50,100,200,500 ,1000,5000, 15000,30000) )
```

**Log - Level Model:** ln\_deaths\_per\_capita = alpha + beta \* cases\_per\_capita (**Figure 4**)

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot( df , aes(x = cases_per_capita, y = deaths_per_capita)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="loess")+
  labs(x = "Registered cases per capita (2019), ln scale",y = "Deaths per capita (2019)")  +
  scale_y_continuous( trans = log_trans(), breaks = c(1,10,100,250,500,1000))
```

**Log - Log Model:** ln\_deaths\_per\_capita = alpha + beta \* ln\_cases\_per\_capita (**Figure 5**)

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot( df , aes(x = cases_per_capita, y = deaths_per_capita))  +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="loess")+
  labs(x = "Total registered cases per capita (2019),ln scale",y = "Total deaths per capita (2019), ln scale")  +
  scale_x_continuous( trans = log_trans(),   breaks = c(1,2,5,10,20,50,100,200,500,1000,7000,15000,30000) )+
  scale_y_continuous( trans = log_trans() )

```

Based on model comparison, our chosen model is ln\_deaths\_per\_capita \~ ln\_cases\_per\_capita

-   Substantive Reasoning: Level changes are hard to interpret due to non linearity of curves. A percentage change gives a better summary of the relationship between deaths\_per\_capita and cases\_per\_capita.

-   Statistical Reasoning: It is a linear model which is easy to interpret and captures the variation well

## **Log Transformation of variables for Regression**

Based on our investigation, we found out that log transformations would work best on both independent and dependent variables. So, we created new log variables for deaths per capita and confirmed cases per capita.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Take Log of death/capita and log cases/capita total
df <- df %>% mutate( ln_deaths_per_capita = log( deaths_per_capita ),
                     ln_cases_per_capita = log( cases_per_capita) )


```

```{r, include=FALSE}
df <- df %>% mutate( ln_cases_per_capita_sq = ln_cases_per_capita^2)
```

## Estimating different Regression models

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Linear Regression
reg_linear <- lm_robust( ln_deaths_per_capita ~ ln_cases_per_capita , data = df , se_type = "HC2" )

# Quadratic Regression
reg_quad <- lm_robust( ln_deaths_per_capita ~ ln_cases_per_capita + ln_cases_per_capita_sq , data = df )

# Regression with piecewise linear spline
# 1st define the cutoff for gdp per capita
cutoff <- c(4000,7500,25000)
# 2nd we use a log transformation -> cutoff needs to be transformed as well
cutoff_ln<- log( cutoff )
# Use simple regression with the lspline function
reg_pls <- lm_robust(ln_deaths_per_capita ~ lspline( ln_cases_per_capita , cutoff_ln ), data = df )

# Weighted OLS Regression
reg_wgt_ols <- lm_robust(ln_deaths_per_capita ~ ln_cases_per_capita, data = df , weights = population)


```

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Creating model summary with texreg
data_out <- "C:/Users/abc/OneDrive/Business_Analytics/DA1-BA/Assignment_2/out/"
htmlreg( list(reg_linear,reg_quad,reg_pls,reg_wgt_ols),
         type = 'html',
         custom.model.names = c("cases/capita - linear","cases/capita - quadratic",
                                "cases/capita - pls", "cases/capita- weighted linear"),
         caption = "Modelling deaths per capita and confirmed cases per capita",
         file = paste0( data_out ,'model_comparison1.html'), include.ci = FALSE)

```

**Figure 5** shows a table with the comparisons of all the models listing the various average coefficients , R2, adjusted R2 and RMSE. The model with the highest R2 is the weighted OLS regression with 0.90 while all the models give the same R2 of 0.79. The weighted OLS also has the highest RMSE with 4.22 which means that the data points are far from the regression line.

The best choice for model according to our results is the Linear Regression model:

*ln\_deaths\_per\_capita = alpha + beta \* ln\_cases\_per\_capita*

Interpretation of B1: This model and its results tells us that for a 10% increase in confirmed cases per capita per million, we observe 9.4% higher deaths per capita per million on average.

## Residual Analysis

```{r, include=FALSE}

# Get the predicted y values from the model
df$reg_linear_y_pred <- reg_linear$fitted.values
# Calculate the errors of the model
df$reg_linear_res <- df$ln_deaths_per_capita - df$reg_linear_y_pred

# Find countries with largest negative errors
df %>% top_n( -5 , reg_linear_res ) %>% 
      select( country ,death, ln_deaths_per_capita , reg_linear_y_pred, reg_linear_res )

# Find countries with largest positive errors
df %>% top_n( 5 , reg_linear_res ) %>% 
       select( country, death,  ln_deaths_per_capita , reg_linear_y_pred, reg_linear_res )

```

**Countries with largest negative errors**

This category includes countries like Maldives, Sri Lanka, Qatar, Burundi, and Singapore. The largest negative deviance from the predicted value is found in \`Burundi\` with predicted deaths per capita of \`27.66\`, but the real value is only \`25.1\`.These countries have predicted Y values greater than the log values of deaths\_per\_capita. This means that their death\_per\_capita per million is lower than what is predicted. It needs to be investigated further as to what initiatives have led to a lower deaths per capita per million value.

**Countries with largest positive errors**

This category includes countries such as Belgium, Italy, Mexico, United Kingdom, and Yemen. - The largest positive deviance from the predicted value is found in \`Belgium\` with predicted deaths per capita of '32.65', but the real value is \`34.29\`. These countries have predicted Y values lower than their actual ln\_deaths\_per\_capita value. This means that their death\_per\_capita per million is higher than what is predicted. Again, further investigation would be required to see what policies and actions led to higher than predicted ln\_death\_per\_capita values.

## Testing hypothesis

We test the following hypothesis:

H0 - B= 0 : There is no relationship between ln\_deaths\_per\_capita and ln\_cases\_per\_capita

HA - B != 0 : There is a relationship between between ln\_deaths\_per\_capita and ln\_cases\_per\_capita

```{r, echo = FALSE}

# 1) Coefficient is equal to 0:
summary( reg_linear)

```

We will use a significant value of 0.05 to check whether we can reject null hypothesis. Our results show that we received an estimated p value of 5.255e-48 which is very close to zero and t value of 20.66 which is greater than 2. Since the p value is less than 0.05, we reject null hypothesis and conclude that there is a relationship between between ln\_deaths\_per\_capita and ln\_cases\_per\_capita.

## Conclusion

We used deaths\_per\_capita and cases\_per\_capita variables and transformed them into log variables which gave us a linear pattern of association. Then we ran several regression models and the simple linear regression model gave us the best fit in terms of good R2 and low RMSE. Hypothesis testing showed that there is a relation between deaths\_per\_capita and cases\_per\_capita. Our results would be weakened if it was revealed that the governments had lied about the Covid statistics in their countries. Ou results would be strengthened if we could account for variables such as underlying sicknesses that actually led to the death of the individuals.

**Figure 2: Level - Level Model**

The graph shows a non-linear pattern with majority of values clustered towards the left while a few extreme values pull on the conditional mean towards the right hand side. We will run log models on the independent and dependent variables to check if we get better results.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8,fig.height=4}

```

**Figure 3: Level - Log Model**

We transformed the independent variable (cases\_per\_capita) and visualized the model. Non-parametric regression on the model shows a non-linear pattern here as well. Non parametric regressions are very volatile at both ends of the curves as you can see by the wide shaded area (confidence intervals).

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8,fig.height=5}
ggplot( df , aes(x = cases_per_capita, y = deaths_per_capita)) +

```

**Figure 4: Log - Level Model**

The graph shows a non linear pattern with majority of values clustered on the left side making the graph harder to interpret and analyze.

ggplot( df , aes(x = cases_per_capita, y = deaths_per_capita)) +

  labs(x = "Registered cases per capita per million, ln scale",y = "Deaths per capita per million")  +
  scale_y_continuous( trans = log_trans())

```

This transformation shows a linear pattern with the values distributed across the graph giving us a better approximation.

**Figure 7: Linear Regression Visualization**

This is the best model for estimating coefficients. R2 is 0.79 which tells us that 7.9% of the variation in the dependent variable (deaths per capita) is explained by the independent variable (cases per capita). It also has a small RMSE which means that the data points are concentrated around the regression line.

*ln\_deaths\_per\_capita = alpha + beta \* ln\_cases\_per\_capita*
